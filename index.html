      The military uses the electromagnetic spectrum — essential, yet invisible — to detect, deceive and disrupt the enemy while protecting friendly forces. As enemies become more capable and threats more complex, controlling the spectrum is increasingly critical.

      Staying ahead in this era calls for a new generation of capabilities. Northrop Grumman’s expertise in electronic warfare, cyber and electromagnetic maneuver warfare spans all domains – land, sea, air, space, cyberspace and the electromagnetic spectrum. Northrop Grumman’s multispectral, multifunction systems give warfighters superiority across the spectrum and allow for faster, more informed decisions.

      Northrop Grumman has provided Naval Airborne Electronic Warfare solutions for more than 55 years and is the Airborne Electronic Attack System Integrator for the U.S. Navy warfighter.

      In the air, Northrop Grumman electronic warfare systems help ensure that strike aircraft can reach their targets and return home safely. As survivability and targeting converge in the electromagnetic spectrum, Northrop Grumman’s technologies are addressing the advanced electronic warfare threats. Situational awareness is critical to air dominance and our airborne electronic warfare systems allow warfighters to disrupt, deceive and deny a broad range of electronic systems.  
      Northrop Grumman continues to be the leader in design, development and delivery of end-to-end electronic maneuver warfare solutions to the U.S. Navy. From building, maintaining and upgrading electronic sensing systems for the Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowler and Boeing EA-18G Growler electronic combat aircraft, to producing radar warning receivers and electronic support measures for other platforms like the Boeing P-8A Poseidon – Northrop Grumman is leading the way.
